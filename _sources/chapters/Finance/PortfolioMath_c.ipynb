    "1. **See risk through a portfolio lens** — Grasp Markowitz's insight that an asset's danger depends on what it adds to the *whole* mix, not on its stand-alone volatility\n",
    "2. **Express returns, means, and variance with matrix algebra** — Use $R_p = W'R$, $E[R_p]=W'E[R]$, and $\\text{Var}(R_p)=W'\\Sigma W$ to scale from two assets to hundreds\n",
    "3. **Quantify diversification benefits** — Investigate how adding a higher-volatility asset can *lower* portfolio variance when correlations are below one\n",
    "4. **Compute and interpret portfolio weights** — Distinguish long-only, short, and leveraged positions; verify that weights sum to one"
